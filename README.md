# SwiftyLua
Swift&lt;->Lua Bridge Framework (iOS)

The intention is to seperate application logic into Lua and let Swift to handle the *hard* part. Similar to what have done in many *scriptable* games, the engine will deal with underlying game loop, rendering, user input, event detection etc., and leave the game logic to the script. Decouple policy from mechanism gives both part the felexibiltiy to evlove without breaking the other side.
